# Text Analysis with NLP

## Instructions

* We suggest to use the Spacy NLP library as a baseline and import additional packages as needed. But feel free to use something else if you feel it gives a better result.
* Please structure and document your code, so we can follow your thought process.
* Please use git and push code changes on a frequent basis to a private project. You can fork the initial repository to get started.
* We're interested in the quality of the technical solution, but also how easy it is to work with you.
* We're also interested if you can improve on the suggested solution below or uncover aspects/approaches that we may not have considered.
